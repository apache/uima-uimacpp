   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   UIMA (/juˈiːmə/ yoo-EE-mə),^[1] short for Unstructured Information
   Management Architecture, is an OASIS standard^[2] for content
   analytics, originally developed at IBM. It provides a component
   software architecture for the development, discovery, composition, and
   deployment of multi-modal analytics for the analysis of unstructured
   information and integration with search technologies.

Structure[edit]

   The UIMA architecture can be thought of in four dimensions:
    1. It specifies component interfaces in an analytics pipeline.
    2. It describes a set of design patterns.
    3. It suggests two data representations: an in-memory representation
       of annotations for high-performance analytics and an XML
       representation of annotations for integration with remote web
       services.
    4. It suggests development roles allowing tools to be used by users
       with diverse skills.

Implementations and uses[edit]

   Apache UIMA, a reference implementation of UIMA, is maintained by the
   Apache Software Foundation.

   UIMA is used in a number of software projects:
     * IBM Research's Watson uses UIMA for analyzing unstructured
       data.^[4]
     * The Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (Apache
       cTAKES) is a UIMA-based system for information extraction from
       medical records.
     * DKPro Core is a collection of reusable UIMA components for
       general-purpose natural language processing.
